# snp_variant_estimation_calibration
a genomeflow analysis for the snp variant analysis from the genome requencing to trait selection for the machine learning. Given a genome and the resequencing reads, it estimates the snps and filters the vcf snp for the coverage estimated and tags those snps for a convolutional network and a sandwich BiLSTM neural network for the prediction.
